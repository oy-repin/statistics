## Projects in Mathematical Statistics

Welcome to my repository dedicated to projects related to the application of mathematical statistics! Here, you will find two projects in which I utilized the scipy.stats, pingouin, and statsmodels libraries to conduct analysis and hypothesis testing using statistical methods.

About the Projects
Each project represents a practical application of statistical methods for data analysis and hypothesis testing. During the execution of these projects, I employed the following tools and libraries:

Programming Language: **Python**

Libraries: **scipy.stats, pingouin, statsmodels**

Analysis Methods: **t-tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA), correlation analysis**

Statistical Hypotheses: **testing differences between groups, dependencies between variables**

Repository Usage
To explore the projects, navigate to the respective directory and open the Jupyter Notebook. Here, you will discover analysis steps, statistical calculations, and interpretation of results.
